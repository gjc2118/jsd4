# Customerio

A node client for the Customer.io [REST API](http://customer.io/docs/api/rest.html).

## Installation

```
npm install --save customerio-node
```

## Usage

### Creating a new instance

In order to start using the library, you first need to create an instance of the CIO class:

```
var cio = new CIO(siteId, apiKey);
```

Both the `siteId` and `apiKey` are **required** in order to create a Basic Authorization header, allowing us to associate the data with your account.

---

### cio.identify(id, data)

Creating a person is as simple as identifying them with this call. You can also use this method to update a persons data.

```
cio.identify(1, {
  first_name: 'Finn',
  last_name: 'Mertens'
});
```

#### Options

- **id**: String (required)
- **data**: Object (optional)

---

### cio.destroy(id)

This will delete a person from Customer.io.

```
cio.destroy(1);
```

#### Options

- **id**: String (required)

---

### cio.track(id, data)

The track method will trigger events within Customer.io. When sending data along with your event, it is required to send a name key/value pair in you data object.

**Simple event tracking**

```
cio.track(1, { name: 'updated' });
```

**Sending data with an event**
```
cio.track(1, {
  name: 'updated',
  data: {
    updated: true,
    plan: 'free'
  }
});
```

#### Options

- **id**: String (required)
- **data**: Object (required)
  - _name_ is a required key on the Object
  - _data_ is a required key if additional data is to be sent over with the event

---

### cio.trackPageView(id, url)

Sending a page event includes sending over the customers id and the name of the page.

```
cio.trackPageView(1, '/home');
```

#### Options

- **id**: String (required)
- **url**: String (required)

### Using Promises

Our library is built with [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/) - which means that every call is wrapped in a [Promise](https://promisesaplus.com/) object. Allowing you to chain your calls with `then`, `catch` and `finally`.

```
var customerId = 1;

cio.identify(customerId, { first_name: 'Finn' }).
  then(function(){
    cio.track(customerId, {
      name: 'updated',
      data: {
        updated: true,
        plan: 'free'
      }
    });
  });
```

## Tests

```
npm install && npm test
```
